This app is a WIP.

 Safe-T-Tube allows:
 1) A parent to create a list of vetted videos
 2) A parent or child to add to a viewing list from the vetted videos
 
 Both features above are working.  Tagging has been modeled, but it is not yet implemented.
 
 You try out what's working so far at: [Safe-T-Tube](https://vast-dawn-24320.herokuapp.com/)
 
 NOTE: When entering a youtube video id it is not the entire URL as in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfYm_bOO50M, but rather
 FfYm_bOO50M is all that you need enter. Validation of that field will be added in the future.
