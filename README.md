**This app is a WIP.**

## **Safe-T-Tube allows:**
 1) A parent to create a list of videos to vet and approve or delete them as desired.
 2) A parent or child to view videos that were approved for viewing.
 
 Both features above are working.  Tagging has been modeled, but it is not yet implemented.
 
 You try out what's working so far at: [Safe-T-Tube](https://vast-dawn-24320.herokuapp.com/)
 
## **Using the app:**
  * After creating your account and are logged in, you must create at least one profile to
 save videos under.
 
  * To add videos click 'Add Video'.  You will be prompted for your parent pin.
 
  * Before adding a video you must select a profile by clicking on one.
 
  * As you add videos the last video added is loaded into the video player.
 
  * You can change the current loaded video by clicking on the video thumbnails.
 
  * To approve a video click 'Approve'.  It will now be available for viewing under the
 profile you selected.
 
  * To delete a video click 'Delete'.  That video is no longer available.
 
  * To exit the parent mode click 'Exit Parent Mode'.  You will be returned to the Home 
 screen.  As with the parent mode, clicking on a thumbnail loads the corresponding
 video into the player.
 
 
## **Notes** 

 Prior to 8/31 you had to add a video by the ID, now you can use the Share URL or
 link address of the video; the ID by itself will produce an error.
 
 If you added any videos prior to 8/31 you will see the default thumbnail when no 
 thumbnail was pulled from YouTube.  I am working to refresh those thumbnails. You can
 still click on them to load the video, if you entered a valid youtube video.
