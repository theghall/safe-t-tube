## This app is now called Your Family UTube, but I am keeping the repo name as is for now ##

## **Your Family UTube:**
 1) A parent to create a list of YouTube&trade; videos to vet and approve or delete them as desired.
 2) A parent or child to view videos that were approved for viewing.
 
 Try out [Your Family UTube](https://familyutube.herokuapp.com/)
 
## **Using the app:**
  * After creating your account and are logged in, you must create at least one profile to
 save videos under. You can do this in Parent Mode.
 
  * To enter Parent Mode, press 'Parent Mode'.  You will be prompted for your parent pin. In Parent Mode you can add videos for review or manage videos you have previously approved.
 
  * Before adding a video you must select a profile by clicking on one.

  * When you tab off the YouTube&trade; URL field or move focus to the tag field you will see the
 video in the viewer so you can see what you are entering tags for.
 
  * Each user has their own tag namespace, so other users' tags won't pollute yours. 
 
  * As you add videos the last video added is loaded into the video player.
 
  * You can change the current loaded video by clicking on the video thumbnails.
 
  * To approve a video click 'Approve'.  It will now be available for viewing under the
 profile you selected.
 
  * To delete a video click 'Delete'.  That video is no longer available.
 
  * You can search for videos by tag in either parent or viewing mode
 (Currently working on autocomplete for tags)

  * To exit the parent mode click 'Exit Parent Mode'.  You will be returned to the Home 
 screen.  As with the parent mode, clicking on a thumbnail loads the corresponding
 video into the player.
 
 
## **Notes** 

 Prior to 8/31 you had to add a video by the ID, now you can use the Share URL or
 link address of the video; the ID by itself will produce an error.
 
 Also, if prior to 9/6 you entered a valid URL you should see the proper thumbnail.  If you
 you see a gray film strip looking thumbnail, either there was an error retrieving
 it or that is the thumbnail.  You can try refreshing your browser.  When the videos
 are loaded for a profile an attempt is made to refresh those thumbnails.
